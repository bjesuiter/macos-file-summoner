### Note on Permissions

MacOS MAY ask you for the following permissions:

- Controlling Finder: needed to find the active folder path in the finder window where 'File Summoner' was activated
- Access to locations on your disk (to create new files)

You need to grant both for the app to work.

### How to install - Text Instructions

1. Download the file 'File.Summoner.x.x.x.dmg' from the latest release of this software at [Github Latest Releases](https://github.com/bjesuiter/macos-file-summoner/releases/latest). The part x.x.x means the version number of the latest release.

2. Open the dmg file
3. Drag and drop the App to your macOS 'Applications' folder link inside the dmg
4. Add the app to your finder toolbar
   1. Open a new finder window
   2. Right click on a space section of the finder toolbar and click 'Adjust toolbar'
   3. Open a second finder Window and navigate to /Applications
   4. Drag the icon of `File Summoner.app` from the second finder window to the toolbar of the first,
      to the location where you want to have the icon for creating a new file.

     https://perchance.org/emoji

## Todos

- improve icon to better fit macOS Finder style
- Add i18n to the app based on the language of the host macos
- copy the string in ./version' into the 'Info.plist' file for the app to avoid manual version updating in Info.plist
- github actions build does not work when downloaded from github (no .app, no .dmg)
  - TODO: make zip of .app and notarize this => Test again
- Publish App in Mac App Store (https://developer.apple.com/macos/submit/)

## Ideas

- Implement a better designed 'new File' Dialog based on [Gio](https://gioui.org/)
- Add more 'File Creators' besides simple 'touch'
  - essential for Microsoft Office files
  - for example, creating my-document.docx with "File Summoner.app" currently results in a broken file
